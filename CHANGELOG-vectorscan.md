# Vectorscan Change Log

This is a list of notable changes to Vectorscan, in reverse chronological order. For Hyperscan Changelog, check CHANGELOG.md

## [5.4.12] 2025-07-21

Multiple changes since last release, this will be the last 100% ABI and API compatible with Hyperscan release.
Next versions will include major refactors and API extensions, it will be mostly backwards compatible however.
Without particular order, platform support is now:

* Linux (x86, Arm, Power)
* FreeBSD 14 (x86, Arm, Power)
* MacOS 14+ (x86, Arm)

In total more than 200 configurations in the CI are tested for every PR.

Other features:
- Fat Runtime supported for Arm as well (ASIMD/SVE/SVE2).
- Initial implementations for Arm SVE/SVE2 algorithms added, thanks to Yoan Picchi from Arm.
- SIMDe support added, used as an alternative backend for existing platforms, but mostly interesting for allowing Vectorscan to build in new platforms without a supported SIMD engine.
- Various speedups and optimizations.
- Cppcheck and clang-tidy fixes throughout the code, both have been added to CI for multiple configurations, but only cppcheck triggers a build failure for now.

Various bugfixes, most important listed:
- Speed up truffle with 256b TBL instructions (#290)
- Fix Clang Tidy warnings (#295)
- Clang 17+ is more restrictive on rebind<T> on MacOS/Boost, remove warning (#332)

- Fixed out of bounds read in AVX512VBMI version of fdr_exec_fat_teddy â€¦ (#333)
- Fix noodle SVE2 off by one bug (#313)
- Make vectorscan accept \0 starting pattern (#312)
- Fix 5.4.11's config step regression (#327)
- Fix double shufti's vector end false positive (#325)
